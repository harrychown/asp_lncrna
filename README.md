Investigating the Transcriptional Response to Itraconazole in Aspergillus Fumigatus

**Validation of lncRNAs using SRA data**

We validated the presence of lncRNAs in other datasets by utilising sequencing reads from public experiments. Three experiments were used to validate this: a time-series experiment on _Aspergillus fumigatus_ after exposure to itraconazole (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA482512), expression analysis after iron-starvation and oxidative stress (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA374516) and transcriptional response after calcium exposure of wildtype, _crzA_ and _zipD_ mutants (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/RJNA445394). 

SRA read accessions were downloaded and name accordingly
